## COVID-19 FAQ Bot: Everything you need to  know about QA Similarity

This project is to build an automatic response system for COVID-19 FAQ based Question&Answering system.

Most of them have common questions like
* How does the virus spread?
* What are the symptoms?
* Is there a vaccine?
* How long does the virus survive on surfaces?


I've chosen un.org (https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/new_dhmosh_covid-19_faq.pdf) website COVID-19 FAQ data for building our QA similarity system. It has 39 different FAQ based questions for COVID-19.

In this project will be discussing on how to build automatic COVID-19 FAQ bot to retrieve answers for FAQ questions.
1. Data collection - COVID-19 FAQ data
2. Data preparation
3. Data preprocessing
4. Techniques for Question representations
5. Evaluate with user query
